# Brief

This project was created together as a co-project together with Digital designer students. The assignment we was given was to create a landing-page for a cultural experience organisation.

The aim of this project is to combine our skills and create a landing page that has a mobile-first view but also is desktop friendly. It's purpose is to showcase the company's projects (aka LABs) and promote their work to their community.
